### Why did I create this github?
I believe github can help users together and find vulns with gamers / websites and publicly post the patches This is an easy way to help the internet be safer / faster as known pathces that haven't been patched need to be fixed as this can cause outages with all kinds of companys.
Github is my side-job and why not post code that might help people in the long run?


Cheers, Snoopdev
